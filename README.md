# DeepAudioClassification
 • Developed a Deep Learning Model using TensorFlow to classify Capuchin bird calls from the rest forest sound. 
 • Implemented audio processing techniques, including Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and spectrogram generation. 
 • Managed dataset preparation from Kaggle, ensuring high-quality input for model training. 
 • Designed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a focus on precision and recall metrics. 
 • Achieved high accuracy in classification, visualizing results with Matplotlib.
